# README: Installing Vagrant, VirtualBox and Using `vagrant up` and `vagrant ssh`

## Introduction

Vagrant is a tool used for building and managing virtual machine environments. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of installing Vagrant and a virtual box, and using the `vagrant up` and `vagrant ssh` commands to start and log into a virtual machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you will need to have the following installed on your computer:

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- VirtualBox, a free and open-source virtualization software
- Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments

## Installing Vagrant and VirtualBox

1. Download and install VirtualBox from the [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

2. Download and install Vagrant from the [Vagrant website](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

## Starting a Virtual Machine

1. Navigate to the directory that contains your `Vagrantfile` in the terminal.

2. Start the virtual machine by running the following command:

vagrant up


This command will use the configuration specified in your `Vagrantfile` to start the virtual machine.

## Logging into a Virtual Machine

1. Log into the virtual machine by running the following command:

vagrant ssh


This will open a secure shell connection to the virtual machine.

## Login Credentials

The following credentials can be used to log into the virtual machine:

- `vagrant` user:
- username: `vagrant`
- password: `vagrant`

- `root` user:
- username: `root`
- password: `vagrant`

## Conclusion

With these steps, you should now have a basic understanding of how to install Vagrant and VirtualBox, start a virtual machine using a pre-existing `Vagrantfile`, and log into it using the specified credentials. You can now start using Vagrant to manage your virtual machine environments.
